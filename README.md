# Vyper-AI
Vyper is a basic AI that I have created with the goal to become better. It has games and other useful and random functions. It has around 500+ lines and it is pretty organized in my opinion. 

As of now, there's no way to save info. I don't know how to read/write to a text file and actively store it to be recalled. Type "about" in the AI to get some more info
